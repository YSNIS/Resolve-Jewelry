			<br>I love making personalized sets! Consider picking a theme and giving each bridesmaid her own special piece. It's an extremely personal way to thank the group standing with you on your wedding day.

			<br>You don't want to outsource a ring that will be the reminder of so many wonderful moments. I use materials made in the USA and do all fabrication in Baltimore, MD. There will be no question about how unique your ring is. You'll be able to request any style you'd like.

			<br>Maybe you have some found objects that would be the perfect sentimental gift. Or maybe you've seen some pieces out in the world that you wish were detailed just a little differently. I've always loved giving gifts more than receiving. I'd love to help you put together the perfect present for friends and family! Send me pictures of what you like or what you have and we can come up with something excellent.
