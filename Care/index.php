<p>Please be considerate of the slight variations that exist between pieces. This is the nature of handcrafting, and the reason Resolve is special to me.</p>
<br>
<p>To properly care for your jewelry, avoid showering, bathing or swimming while wearing your piece. I use untreated brass, bronze, copper and sterling silver. Even with perfect care, these metals develop a patina over time from exposure to air, moisture, dirt and oils. Resolve Jewelry designs are enhanced by an antique finish, pieces become more defined as colors begin to change.</p>
<br>
<p>Did you have a green reaction to your brass jewelry? It's the copper element reacting with your skin. Don't worry! There's nothing harmful about that and those green reactions can be washed off with soap and water.</p>
<br>
<p>To maintain a bright finish, keep jewelry clean and dry, store in an airtight container. Avoid contact with skin care products, hair products, cooking and cleaning products. If using polishing supplies, please follow instructions carefully.</p>
