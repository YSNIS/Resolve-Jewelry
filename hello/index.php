	I started Resolve as a fun project on a cluttered desk in my house. Started picking and pulling at bits of broken necklaces and earrings.  
	<br>
	<br>
	Now I'm taking metalsmith classes at the Baltimore Jewelry Center. I'm sharing studio space with the best. I feel more satisfied than I knew I could, though it can be tough. In fact, my jewelry line is named as blantant personal reminder to push past difficulty and exhaustion. Because those moments can hit hard. But I'm all in. Resolve comes from what's bound and determined.

	 Every place I visit, I end up buying myself a piece of jewelry. It's small enough to carry with me, and a wearable reminder of the beauty around where I've been. My 9-5 kicks back in after each trip. But my love for beauty is nonstop. To strike a balance while home, I try to say yes to any creative pursuit. I believe as we grow we start to realize what we are capable of. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Jewelry making is an art I admire and something I decided to say yes to. I'm so happy I did. I started by first making jewelry for myself and my friends. It was making everyone happy and I was encouraged to share it beyond an inner circle. I now study at the Baltimore Jewelry Center where I also share studio space. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I like to think that there is something for everyone here. I make unique pieces inspired with many styles in mind, for all the different items in my closet. You'll notice each piece is given a name. I tend to think there's a bit of personality to each design. I hope you like what you find.-->


			<!--</br></br>This venture into jewelry design is balanced with a highly contrasting 9-5 day job. For all the exhaustion, I know I wouldn't be this far without love for this project and love from my friends.  
			</br></br>I start with sketches and which I later form by hand at a beautiful shared studio space. My influences come from all sorts of natural objects around me. My metalwork curriculum started with the Baltimore Jewelry Center at the bright-eyed age of 27.  
			</br></br>As for the name, I asked myself why this project has been different, when most of my craft supplies sadly end up piling dust on a shelf. It's exciting to fall in love with something this way, a way I've only felt toward people until now. There's a commitment that feels natural. And I think that's the difference. When I found jewelry design, I found my resolve.-->
